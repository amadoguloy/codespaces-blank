This is one of my first projects.

Using DASH, matplotlib, and pandas, as well as disease.sh, this is a simpl interactive COVID-19 tracker.

Using your mouse, you can move up and down to look at the number of cases as well as from side to side to move th date. Currently the y-axis is per day. That will be changed in future versions.
