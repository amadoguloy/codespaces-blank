This is one of my first projects.

Requirements:
DASH
matplotlib
pandas
access to disease.sh website

How to use:
Using your mouse, you can move up and down to look at the number of cases as well as from side to side to move the date. Currently the y-axis is per day. That will be changed in future versions.
